1: YOU CAN EITHER DELETE THE ASSETS FILES IN YOUR OX INVENTORY OR ALSO DRAG AND DROP THE FILES ON YOUR DESKTOP.

2: ONCE YOU'VE DONE STEP 1 YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP THE ASSETS FROM MY FOLDER, RESTART THE SERVER LOAD IN, AND SEE IF EVERYTHING LOOKS RIGHT.

4: YOU CAN CHANGE THE PICTURE WITH YOUR CUSTOM SERVER LOGO.
